                Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus's orbit is smaller than that of Earth, but its maximal elongation is 47Â°; thus, it can be seen not only near the Sun in the morning or evening, but also a couple of hours before or after sunrise or sunset, depending on the observer's latitude and on the positions of Venus and the Sun. Most of the time, it can be seen either in the morning or in the evening. At some times, it may even be seen a while in a completely dark sky.             </p>
